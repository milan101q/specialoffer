🚗 Project Brief: Multi-Dealer Car Listing Website with Smart Inventory Syncing

Objective:
Build a full-featured car listing platform that aggregates inventory from multiple dealership websites. The goal is to provide users with a fast, seamless, and intuitive way to search, filter, and view vehicle listings—while connecting them directly to verified dealership sources. The app will fetch vehicle data by parsing individual listing pages from dealer websites. If available, a Carfax link (typically shown under the vehicle photo) should also be captured.

✅ Core Features
🏪 Dealer Inventory Import (Auto-Scraper)
Admin can input dealership website URLs via the dashboard.

The platform automatically scrapes car details from each listing page, including:

Year, Make, Model

Mileage

VIN number

Price

Location / ZIP code (scraped from listing)

Photos

Carfax report link (if available)

Original listing URL (on dealer site)

🔁 Real-Time Inventory Sync
The system detects when a vehicle has been sold or removed from the dealership's website.

Those vehicles should be automatically removed from the platform.

This sync should run on a scheduled interval (e.g., every 2–6 hours).

🖼️ Vehicle Listing Page
Each car listing should display:

Vehicle photos

Title (e.g., “2018 Toyota Camry SE”)

Year, Make, Model, Mileage, VIN, ZIP code

View Carfax Report button (opens in new tab if link exists)

Contact Seller button (links to original dealer page)

🔍 Search & Filter System
Search Bar (Top of Page):

Users can search by:

Keywords (e.g., “2020 Camry”)

VIN

Make/Model

Year

Filters (Sidebar or Dropdown):

Make/Brand (multi-select)

Year range

Price range

Mileage range

ZIP code or location radius

Sorting Options:

Price (Low → High, High → Low)

Year (Newest → Oldest)

Mileage (Low → High)

Search and filter results should dynamically update without page reload.
